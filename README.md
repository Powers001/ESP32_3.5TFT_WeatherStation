# ESP32 & 3.5 Inch TFT WeatherStation
This is the accompanying repository for my article "Create an Internet Weather Station with 3 days Forecast on an ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display ("CYD")" available here: https://medium.com/@androidcrypto/create-an-internet-weather-station-with-3-days-forecast-on-an-esp32-cheap-yellow-display-cyd-15eb5c353b1d

For short - what is a "Cheap Yellow Display" ? This device was introduced some years ago and allowed for very fast development of projects where an ESP32, a TFT (optional Touch surface), an SD Card Reader and an RGB LED is required. The first version was equipped with a 2.8 inch large TFT display with **ILI9341** driver chip and **XPT2046** resistive Touch driver chip. Newer versions are sold with a **ST7789** display driver chip. Nowadays, the device is available with different display sizes (1.28 up to 7 inches) and driver chips, but I'm focusing on the 2.8 inch variants. The display has a size of **320 x 240** pixels in Landscape orientation. Most of the devices are driven by an ESP32 WROOM microcontroller, but I saw some others with an ESP32-S3 chip.

## Set up the TFT_eSPI library

Please don't forget to copy the files "*Setup801_ESP32_CYD_ILI9341_240x320.h*" and "*Setup805_ESP32_CYD_ST7789_240x320.h*" in the "User_Setups" folder of the TFT_eSPI library and edit the 
"*User_Setup_Select.h*" to include the set up, depending on your CYD board type (ILI9341 or ST7789).

## Required Libraries
````plaintext
TFT_eSPI Version: 2.4.3 *1) (https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)
OpenWeather Version: Feb 16, 2023 (https://github.com/Bodmer/OpenWeather)
JSON_Decoder Version: n.a. (https://github.com/Bodmer/JSON_Decoder)

## This sketch uses the LittleFS file system
The weather icons and font files are stored in the LittleFS filesystem. Before running the sketch you need to upload the files in the sketch subfolder 'data' to the ESP32, 
for e.g. with the arduino-littlefs-upload plugin (https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload).
